# Algorithm
This repository about how to use Algoritm in C# 

Algoritm is everywhere ,everything got an algoritm 

Algoritm its a procedure for solving problems or compuation even a way to collect information about things .

Some of the reason we use algoritm in programming are solving problems and to make it Code solving efficiency
and facilitate the compilation process and save time for unnecessary memory.
This analysis of the algoritm efficiency is often represented by using the Big O notation.
The big O describe the efficiency of algorithms .
In my repository i will show you how to use some of the mehods to slove thing with Algoritm.
